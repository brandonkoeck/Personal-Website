Welcome to my **personal website**!

### Project Description
I developed this website as a full-stack project for my Web Tech class. It was hosted on the AWS EC2 instance and connected to a MySQL database using PHPMyAdmin. It features many pages about me, including a working contact and registration page. This project helped me learn how the front and backend of websites work and how to work with databases and RESTful APIs.

### Project Features
- Homepage featuring links to different pages about me
- A working contact page linked to a MySQL database
- A working login/registration page linked to a MySQL database
- Password hashing for each password

### Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Bash (for backend server)
